1. Nesting level (2 level deep): if next else then inside on las else, another if
1. Nesting level (3 level deep): ![Nesting level (3 level deep)](https://i.imgur.com/dqI937S.png)

#### Return early or guard clause

- The idea here is that instead of having logic to write in a variable and then return it, you should just return the value once it's calculated.

#### Remove unnecessary else's from code

- What we want to point out in this case is that this is completely optional and does not add any value in this particular instance.

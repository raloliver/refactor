In the code you'll find one file called "initial.js" and a folder called "solution" where you can find "solution.js", which as you might have guessed contains the solution for the exercise.

The "initial.js" is your starting point and it contains the goal of the exercise and what you should see when you run the code.


To run the code you need to have nodejs installed (https://nodejs.org/en/). Feel free to download any version.


Once installed all you have to do is open a command-prompt in the folder containing "initial.js" and first type "npm install" and then type "node initial" in your command prompt.

This should run the code with all its dependencies installed.


NOTE: In some exercises, when you type "npm install", you might see error "ENOENT": no such file or directory, this is fine, in this exercises there is no external dependencies, you can skip the "npm install" and proceed to the "node initial" command.


After you complete the task, to validate, that the changes do not break the correct behavior make sure the code you see matches the "expected output" which you see at the end of "initial.js" file.
